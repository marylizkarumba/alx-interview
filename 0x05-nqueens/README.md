# 0x05. N Queens

## Task
    The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. Write a program that solves the N queens problem.

    Usage: nqueens N
    If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments, print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
    where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
    If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
    If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
    The program should print every possible solution to the problem
    One solution per line
    Format: see example
    You don’t have to print the solutions in a specific order
    You are only allowed to import the sys module

The queen (♕, ♛) is the most powerful piece in the game of chess. It can move any number of squares vertically, horizontally or diagonally, combining the powers of the rook and bishop. Each player starts the game with one queen, placed in the middle of the first rank next to the king. Because the queen is the strongest piece, a pawn is promoted to a queen in the vast majority of cases.

The predecessor to the queen is the ferz, a weak piece only able to move or capture one step diagonally, originating from the Persian game of shatranj. The modern queen gained its power and its modern move in Spain in the 15th century during Isabella I's reign, perhaps inspired by her great political power.

##Backtracking 
This is a class of algorithms for finding solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.[1]

The classic textbook example of the use of backtracking is the eight queens puzzle, that asks for all arrangements of eight chess queens on a standard chessboard so that no queen attacks any other. In the common backtracking approach, the partial candidates are arrangements of k queens in the first k rows of the board, all in different rows and columns. Any partial solution that contains two mutually attacking queens can be abandoned.

Backtracking can be applied only for problems which admit the concept of a "partial candidate solution" and a relatively quick test of whether it can possibly be completed to a valid solution. It is useless, for example, for locating a given value in an unordered table. When it is applicable, however, backtracking is often much faster than brute-force enumeration of all complete candidates, since it can eliminate many candidates with a single test.

Backtracking is an important tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems,[2] such as crosswords, verbal arithmetic, Sudoku, and many other puzzles. It is often the most convenient technique for parsing,[3] for the knapsack problem and other combinatorial optimization problems. It is also the basis of the so-called logic programming languages such as Icon, Planner and Prolog.

Backtracking depends on user-given "black box procedures" that define the problem to be solved, the nature of the partial candidates, and how they are extended into complete candidates. It is therefore a metaheuristic rather than a specific algorithm – although, unlike many other meta-heuristics, it is guaranteed to find all solutions to a finite problem in a bounded amount of time.

The term "backtrack" was coined by American mathematician D. H. Lehmer in the 1950s.[4] The pioneer string-processing language SNOBOL (1962) may have been the first to provide a built-in general backtracking facility.
